Heyo,

I'm Tam. (she/her) As someone who grew up with technology and spent the majority of my childhood and adolesence glued to my computer, I've always wanted to work in an exciting field relevant to our technological advancement. After lacking the confidence throughout my adolescence and early 20s, I've finally decided to pursue a career in security. 

 I suck at documentation, so apologies for the site being mostly bare. To recruiters, thank you for taking the time to look through it regardless.
